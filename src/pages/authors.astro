        The world is at an age where influencers and role models are not
        restricted to those who stand on a stage, own a company, or win medals.
        They now also include those who vlog about their lives, blog about their
        interests, own a podcast, create music from scratch at home and â€¦ write
        stories for the world. Many of the influencers of this time receive a
        lot of adoration, respect and love; and for book lovers, authors and the
        worlds that they create are a home unlike any other.
