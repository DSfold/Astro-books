          "Spellbinding Epic that Touches the Soul - Shantaram Shines Bright",
        body: `Shantaram, penned by Gregory David Roberts, is a tour de force of storytelling
        that has the power to transport readers to the vibrant streets of Mumbai. From the very 
        first page, this extraordinary novel captivates with its sprawling narrative and deeply 
        introspective exploration of the human spirit.
        Roberts' mesmerizing prose beautifully weaves a tapestry of emotions, taking readers on a rollercoaster 
        journey through love, loss, redemption, and self-discovery. The vibrant and vivid descriptions of the city 
        of Mumbai, its bustling markets, and the diverse characters that inhabit its streets breathe life into every scene.
        The protagonist, Lin, is a complex and fascinating character, flawed and yet utterly relatable. As we 
        accompany him on his path of self-reflection and redemption, we are immersed in his innermost thoughts, 
        fears, and desires, forging a profound and lasting connection.`,

        title: "Don't let the heft scare you, this is a gripping story",
        body: `“Shantaram” is a journey through the life of a convict on the lamb, a 
        slum dweller, a prisoner in a crowded Indian jail, a de facto combat medic in 
        the Soviet-Afghan War, and a Bombay gangster. The book is a novel, but mixes in 
        autobiographical elements—at least in broad brush strokes. The author, Gregory David Roberts, was—as 
        with his lead character--an escaped convict who fled his homeland of Australia to find anonymity among 
        the Bombay (now Mumbai) masses. Roberts had taken up armed robbery of banks and institutions to 
        support a heroin habit. However, it’s not clear to what degree the details described in the book 
        echo reality. Roberts is adamant that the other characters in the book are completely fictional, 
        but at least some members of this cast were recognizable as real people—some of whom disagree with the accounting of events in the book.`,

        body: `The book is named Shantaram and I have burned through its 936 pages in about two weeks. 
        If you don't know the book. it is based on the author's Gregory David Roberts own true story of his 
        escaped from a Maximum Security Prison in Australia, and subsequent travel to India to find refuge 
        among slums dwellers and the Mafia of Bombay.
        In Mumbai (Bombay), as a fugitive, with a new identity "Lin" (Roberts), as protagonist lives out an 
        extensional quest for survival, freedom, and redemption so profound, that to set such experiences into 
        an active first person narrative, and place it within the context of the authors own intense confessions 
        as well as an esoteric yet rigorous philosophical cosmology constitutes one of the rarest 
        forms of literary expression. Yet Robert's managed the feat while running a medical clinic 
        in one of the cities darkest slums and inhabiting the Bombay underworld, associating with the most 
        amazing cast of anti-heroes and hoods. The sacred and profane populate this novel; gangsters, gurus, 
        thieves, standing Babas, Sufis, sinners, saints, European ex-pats are all among the odd assortment of 
        humanity who find a home within.`,

        body: `Before I truly get started on my review of American Gods by Neil Gaiman, I should mention a few things. First off,
        I was struck in awe and wonderment at being able to read the works of such a master wordsmith. Neil Gaiman is a craftsman 
        when it comes to words. His prose, while not overly flowery, has a depth of emotion and poetry that is a joy to read.
        Secondly, I benefitted greatly from a website that compiled and explained the mythology behind various gods and characters.
        If you decide to read this book, may I highly recommend bookmarking and referencing "Only The Gods Are Real?" [...]
        Trust me when I say you will appreciate the way Gaiman weaves metaphor and mythology so much MORE when you understand
        the stories he's drawing from. The way he describes the gods and the situations he places them in is nothing short of brilliant.

        body: `This is a standalone book and a large one. It explores the idea of gods, born by man’s
        desire and need, gods stranded in a world that is hardly loyal to them anymore.
        The story is full of twists and revelations and keeps you on your toes for the most part.
        It’s uniqueness of story and characters you might heard of make it a compelling read.
        Our main man protagonist struggles to find his place, struggles to find a reason to be alive.
        It’s a journey of self discovery, while caught in events he can hardly grasp.
        We feel for him and he is likable however his lack of concrete goals and direction limits our 
        levels of engagement. It’s understandable because it’s tied to the story itself, he is not meant
        to understand what is going on and he is meant to struggle to find a meaning in life, but still 
        everything is short stories one after the other with fairly limited actual continuation.
        In the end however it alls fits nicely.`,

        body: `In American Gods, traditions linger and refuse to fade,
        gods are spawned by the handed-down thoughts of immigrants, 
        and belief and reality are one and the same thing. This is a novel 
        about the soul of America, and the heart of the modern world, with maybe 
        just a tad of how our past shaped us, all told through a cast of characters that's as offbeat 
        and well developed as it is numerous.
        Gaiman's themes here are weighty, and they could drag off and drown your average narrative
        with their importance. Gaiman doesn't even try to fight this; he lets the book be tossed to 
        and fro, gyrating wildly and leaping off into tangents in order to explore part after part 
        of his post-mythology mythos. As such, though the story is interesting on its own, and the 
        character's usually well drawn, this is more a novel about America and its synthesis than it is about anything else.`,

        body: `The story at its core encompasses the struggle between the individual
        (portrayed by Randall McMurphy) and the establishment (Portrayed by nurse Ratched.) 
        It is told through the eyes of the schizophrenic half-Indian known as Chief Bromden. 
        Bromden has pretended to be deaf and dumb for so long that everyone takes this fact for granted. 
        It also allows him to overhear comments from the staff that others would not. The Chief 
        is an interesting choice as narrator, and at times it seemed like he was rambling on about nothing. 
        Unreliable narrators can be a touchy thing, but Kesey is able to navigate his way through the Chief's 
        mind, and in time we find his ramblings have a purpose. He views the establishment as a machine, which 
        he refers to as "the combine." He speaks of fog machines, wires in the walls, and robotic people, and 
        views them as part of the combine. Even the name of the nurse, Ratched, sounds almost like "ratchet," 
        which is a common tool. The Chief sees the struggle between the Big Nurse, as he calls Ratched, 
        and McMurphy, and even though he has a sense right away that McMurphy is different, Bromden doesn't 
        hold out much hope. After all, the combine is a massive machine and the Chief knows what it did to him.
        Bromden tells McMurphy he "used to be big," but not any more. The Chief's mother, a white woman from town, 
        along with the government, broke down both he and his father and became bigger than both of them put together.

        The story is told by Chief, the Big Indian. Through his eyes we see the ins and

        the tone for the other patients in the hospital; each goes through life with the pace 
        of a crawl. The processes and procedures are in place to help them acclimate themselves 
        to life outside the ward in hopes that some day they may rejoin society. Or that is what the staff tells them anyway.`,

        the reason for this being I thought less of it due to having seen the film. 
        The film is not bad, but for me One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s nest was its film version, 
        full stop. I eventually decided to read the book after learning about the interesting 
        life its author Ken Kesey lived, including that he wrote much of this book while working at a mental hospital.
        One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest deals with the relationship between freedom and power, 
        and about how mental illness develops when the power of others dominates an individual to 
        such a great extent that he/she can no longer act free. The individuals in the hospital are 
        shown by Kesey to be lacking in courage and self-belief, and demonstrate an unwillingness to act 
        without permission and approval. While the hospital should be making patients better it actually makes 
        them worse by actively discouraging attempts to be assertive and by labelling any attempt to act free from 
        the constraints of institutional power as symptomatic of a worsening of the underlying disorder.`,

        It is not a great "novel" and I am not sure it can even be 
        characterized as a novel, unless its unique style results in a 
        redefinition of the genre. What it is is a great story, thematically thin 
        and deceptively simple in its telling, yet compelling in its hold on the reader. 
        In fact, a better word than compelling would be "propelling". The short chapters made of short paragraphs, 
        that alternate between the destined-to-intersect worlds of the two protagonists, 
        and a third Colombo type investigator, move swiftly and purposefully carrying along the 
        reader like a passenger on a steadily moving train on an express route free of stops or 
        stations to pause or ponder along the way. It doesn't matter that its obvious from the very 
        beginning that the story's denouement will be the union of the two detached and lonesome lovers. 
        In this case, it's not the destination, it's the ride.

          "Life is not like water. Things in life don't necessarily flow over the shortest possible route",
        body: `When sitting down to begin reviewing this novel, many conflicting opinions 
        and ideas have flown through my mind. On a technical level, this book almost fails: 
        the translation can be rough, the plot is often slow and tends to drag, and the characters seem 
        unrealistic and detached. If we were going off of that purely basic merit, I'd probably give this 
        book 3 stars, maybe 3 and 1/2 because I consider myself a Murakami fan. But, in the end, I cannot do that, 
        because, against all odds, the whole of this novel is much greater than the sum of its parts.
        1Q84 by Haruki Murakami is about two people living in Tokyo, 1984.
        Aomame is a powerful, liberated woman who delivers justice in her own vigilante style. 
        The other, a reticent genius named Tengo Kawana, is involved in a controversial behind-closed-doors 
        deal to ghost write a novel. These plots seem to be totally unrelated, but over the course of the year 
        1984, Tengo and Aomame's paths cross, and maybe not just for the first time.`,

        rather get some of my thoughts down now, at roughly the midway point, while they're fresh in my mind.
        Books of this size tend to start slowly, and if the reader isn't sufficiently stimulated he might put 
        it down and never pick it back up. 1Q84 has been different. From the start I've been pulled into Murakami's 
        imaginary world, and as the chapters fly by the story snowballs in complexity and intrigue. Thus far the novel 
        alternates chapters between the two main characters, Aomame and Tengo.        
        Aomame is a young woman who moonlights as an assassin of men who have harmed other women in 
        one form or another. She has her own unique, nearly undetectable way of dispatching them.`,

        But the important shadows -- the play between light and dark -- are those found in the characters.
        This is a book whose narrative is propelled not only by a fantastically 
        imaginative plot, but by characters that are extremely sharply defined. At the beginning of the novel, 
        these characters seem cut out of a teen book -- binary, 0/1 characters strongly identified with good and bad. 
        But by the end, you have discovered all the grey areas in between -- all the emotions that go in to making 
        them what they are -- showing why they are the strongly positive or negative characters they have become.
